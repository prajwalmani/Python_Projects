We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

Eminem
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn,
Rising, a phoenix from the flames,
I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

Dua Lipa
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Want me to listen to you
But you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yet
Let me guess you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now,

Louis Tomlinson
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favorite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us
